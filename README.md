# AI User Reviews Aggregator Project

A small Python project that loads a review dataset and produces aggregated insights (e.g., counts, averages, summaries) to help analyze user feedback.

## Project Structure

- `code/`
  - `main.py` — main script to run the aggregation
  - `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
  - `test.ipynb` — notebook for quick experiments
- `data/`
  - `dataset.zip` — dataset used by the project

## Setup

1) Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows (Git Bash)
source .venv/Scripts/activate
